# CRUD Example Application

This application demonstrates the capabilities of **Chimera Store** and its utility functions for building reactive, type-safe state management in React applications.

## Overview

This example showcases a full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application with:

- **Client-side state management** using Chimera Store
- **Real-time reactivity** and efficient updates
- **Type-safe operations** with TypeScript
- **Built-in filtering and sorting** utilities
- **Optimistic updates** and data synchronization
- **RESTful API integration** with a local server

The app manages two entities (Customers and Orders) to demonstrate relationships, filtering, and typical CRUD patterns you'd encounter in real-world applications.

# Getting Started

To run this application:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

To start the server
